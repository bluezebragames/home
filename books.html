									<h2>Wait, books?</h2>
									<p>You read that right.</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Yeah, we make games, but we also write books. Don't think too hard about it. I suppose we just have so much overflowing creativity that we didn't know what to do with it all.
								</p>
								<p>
									I’d probably write a plot summary here, but that's a bit harder than it sounds. Maybe just trust me that it gets a bit confusing when we have multiple timelines that exist simply to get our characters out of the seemingly infinite number of plot holes we created. In a broad sense, though, our books depict a group of friends (*cough cough* us *cough cough*) who go on crazy adventures.

										<h3>A brief description of the series and of each of the four books</h3>
									</header>
                                    <h1>The Series</h1>
                                    <p>
                                        <em>At the very beginning, That Which 1 started as an obfuscation of Devon’s biology homework on the nervous system.  One interesting part of this obfuscation is the fact that we constructed complicated sentences without the use of the word “what”.  So as you read any of the books you will notice that the words “that which” are used in many of the places in which “what” would normally occur.  Thus, the first chapter title is “(That Which is Defined as) Chapter 42” (which would otherwise read as “([This Chapter is] What is Defined as) Chapter 42”).  Yes, we noticed that the first chapter is chapter 42.  This is exactly the kind of intentional confusion we create again and again.  It sometimes is significant and meaningful.</em>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The first sentence is which “that which” is used is:  “The Nervous System’s purpose simply is to be that which gives us the ability to allow us the ability which we must have in order to use that which is necessary in order to be used for the purpose of having the use of allowing living things to react to their surroundings.”  (Don’t judge us too harshly, here.  We were freshmen, just getting to know each other and getting a sense of writing together.  Our writing has definitely improved over the past three and a half years.)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The joy of replacing “what” with “that which” became secondary to explorations of crazy plot twists, the excitement of constructing fabulous chapter titles (that’s you, “Chapter Smug Butcher (A Tale of Two)” and “An Appetizing Chapter on an Aluminum Plate”), and celebrating the surprises and challenges which cropped up as we went along.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If any of you were wondering how we were able to all collaborate on these books together, the answer is Google Docs.  Apparently, not only is Docs a tool for letting teachers check your progress on your essays or doing group slideshow presentations, but it is also pretty good for books (except for the lag when your books get too long…  right around 197 pages).  In any case, Google, give us money!
                                    </p>
                                    <h1>Book 1:</h1>
                                    <p><em>That Which 1:  The World of The Ptrocanfer</em></p>
									<p>
                                        That Which 1:  The World of The Ptrocanfer, also known as Twitch 1 (of course it was inevitable that we would play with the letters and shorten That Which to Twitch, evidence of how kids these days want to do everything faster), accomplishes a lot of setup for the later books.  Ptrocanfer, by the way, is pronounced “TROW-can-fur”.  The character “The Ptrocanfer” is introduced, along with Danté and Theódore, forming the trio. You might imagine that there is a rough correspondence from the three characters to the three authors, and you would be right.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Other recurring characters such as Don Samuel, a Californian rancher who wants to become an actor; Mr. Stripey, The Ptrocanfer’s “lapis blue unizebra (unicorn/zebra)” who turns the trio into a quadro (a word we constructed to refer to a trio plus one); and Sensei Juan Voodoo, Ph.D., a hippie with more Ph.Ds than even he can count, are mentioned briefly.  Future plot elements also introduced, such as <em>everlasting everlast</em>, a drink which creates an instant adiction; <em>The Ptrocanfer's gun/phone</em>, a device which magically becomes the opposite of whatever The Ptrocanfer wants; and <em>The Ptrocanfer's nose</em>, which suddenly grew on his foot when he ate okra.</p>

                                    <h1>Book 2:</h1>
									<p><em>That Which 2:  Another Cool Compendium of Random Ruminations</em></p>
									<p>
										In Twitch 2, the action really begins.  The first half focuses on a magical cooler which is actually a time travel machine.  The second half of 2 includes one of the best sections of Twitch ever: The Bo0lean (pronounced like the logical concept, boolean) Chronicles. Bo0lean is a detective who gets his first case when a man by the name of N.C. Radovan loses his hat and a year later hires Bo0lean to solve the crime.  Unfortunately, everyone in the book is severely incompetent, especially N.C. Radovan. The case is an absurdly easy one, yet it is never solved, even though observant readers easily come to the right conclusion.  When the Bo0lean Chronicles conclude, readers are treated to the adventures of Don Samuel, who became “Feline Dude” after he ate a mouse. His superpower is the ability to come back to life after dying over and over again, and it is used to its fullest extent, as he dies in basically every chapter, and sometimes even multiple times per chapter. In any case, the book ends with “Lord of the Socks,” an ambitious Lord of the Rings parody.  At the end of the book, the foursome takes off in a rocket ship to go to the moon.

                                    <h1>Book 3:</h1>
                                    <p><em>That Which 3:  In Which That Which Happened is Related</em></p>
									<p>
                                        Twitch 3 begins where 2 leaves off, except for two small details: the Earth has somehow blown up and the characters are in a different spaceship. Despite these obvious inconsistencies, Twitch 3 is one of the best books we've ever written.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A major highlight of Book 3 is <em>The Ptrocanfer's Tedious List of Adjectives and Similes Chapter.</em>  This is a section of the book devoted to similes which could be used to further describe particular adjectives.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Among the authors there was a period of silence when none of us cared about writing book 3 . . .  but then! a miraculous bit of writing concocted <em>The Danté Identity</em> and resurrected Twitch 3.  <em>The Danté Identity</em>, a tangent off of the “plot” (perhaps you have realized the books aren’t exactly plot-driven) is transparently a rip-off of The Bourne Identity, which Devon had recently watched.  In this segment of the book, Danté stars as a spy who is chased around Paris.  He zooms about, first on a Segway and then later a skateboard.  Finally he escapes on top of a train.

                                    <h1>Book 4:</h1>
                                    <p><em>That Which 4: A Dream Not All a Dream</em></p>
									<p>
                                        Twitch 4 was originally going to be a major departure from the first three books, with new main characters, and set centuries into the future, etc.  Then, in a bold move we set the book in the past with the same main characters but a <em>radically different font</em> (see what we did there?). The main theme for Twitch 4 (if any of our books has a “theme”) is backstories. We told the backstories of as many of our characters as we could think of. For example, the reader finally learns of how mysterious Danté’s mysterious past is; Theódore’s life before everlast; the early life of N.C. Radovan, who has become the main antagonist; and the backgrounds of two new characters: The Sneeeze and Señior Flour. Highlights include Theódore getting framed for everlast smuggling by N.C. Radovan in an elaborate plot which includes the brainwashing of an entire city of people.  One of the most interesting parts of Twitch 4 comes at the very end: The N.C. Origins. This book section evolved from a particularly nasty pun, which was created by changing the first letters of “Why is six afraid of seven?  Because seven eight [ate] nine” transforming six into vix, and the pun into “Why is Vix afraid of Sven? Because Sven Nate-Clyde.”  We obviously needed to make from this pun a set of absurd backstories about Sven and Vix.
