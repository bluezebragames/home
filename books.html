									<h2>Wait, books?</h2>
									<p>You read that right.</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Yeah, we're a game company which writes books.  Don't think too hard about it.  I suppose we just have so much overflowing creativity that we didn't know what to do with it all.
								</p>
								<p>
									I'd probably write a plot summary here, but that's a bit harder than it sounds.  Maybe just trust me that it gets a bit confusing when we have multiple timelines that exist simply to get ourselves out of the seemingly infinite number of plotholes we've created.  In a broad sense, though, there's a group of friends (*cough cough* us *cough cough*) and they all do random stuff with great metaphorical significance.

                                    <h1>Book 1:</h1>
									<p>
                                        In That Which 1, also known as Twitch 1, a lot of setup is done.  The Ptrocanfer is introduced, along with Danté and Theódore, forming the trio.  Other recurring characters such as Don Samuel, a Californian rancher who wants to become an actor, Mr. Stripey, The Ptrocanfer's "lapis blue unizebra (unicorn/zebra)" who turns the trio into a quadro, and Sensei Juan Voodoo, Ph.D., a hippie with more Ph.Ds than even he can count, are mentioned briefly.  Future plot elements such as <em>everlasting everlast</em>, a drink which addicts instantly, <em>The Ptrocanfer's gun/phone</em>, a device which becomes the opposite of what The Ptrocanfer wants, and <em>The Ptrocanfer's nose</em>, which grew suddenly on his foot when he ate okra. </p><p>Memorable sentences:

                                    <h1>Book 2:</h1>
									<p>
										In Twitch 2, action starts happening.  We often joke that we can write at most one half of a book which is good.  Almost never is this more true than in 2.  The first half is supposed to be about a magical cooler which is actually a timetravel machine.  It really wasn't that good, though.  The second half of 2 is widely considered to be a dramatic improvement as it changes the focus to one of the best sections of Twitch ever: The Bo0lean Chronicles.  Bo0lean is a detective who also happens to be Danté, but only after Danté "dies."  He gets his first case when a man by the name of N.C. Radovan loses his hat and comes to Bo0lean a year later.  The only problem is that everyone in the book is severely incompetent, especially N.C. Radovan.  After the Bo0lean Chronicles is the adventures of Don Samuel, who became "Feline Dude" after he ate a mouse.  His superpower is the ability to just keep dying over and over again, and it is used to full extent, dying in basically every chapter, sometimes even multiple times per chapter.  In any case, the book ends with the mediocre "Lord of the Socks," a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> parody which really never took off. (Until the end of the book, where the quadro literally takes off in a rocket ship to go to the moon.)

                                <h1>Book 3:</h1>
									<p>
                                        Twitch 3 takes off where 2 leaves off: in space... except for the small facts that the Earth has somehow blown up and they're in a different spaceship.  Despite this obvious inconsistency, Twitch 3 is still one of the best books we've ever written.  Differently from 2, where there was an obvious first half which was a lot worse than the second one, 3 has some good parts in the first half, mostly <em>The Ptrocanfer's Tedious List of Adjectives and Similes Chapter.</em>  Unfortunately, the middle half of 3 is really bad, mostly because it wasn't The Ptrocanfer's writing.  There was a period of silence where no one cared about 3... but then!  A miraculous event called <em>The Danté Identity</em> happened.  <em>The Danté Identity</em>, a tangent off of the "plot" (we don't really have a plot), is a bad ripoff of The Bourne Identity, which The Ptrocanfer had recently watched.  Danté is a spy who is chased around Paris, on a Segway and then later a skateboard, and escapes on top of a train.

                                <h1>Book 4:</h1>
									<p>
                                        Twitch 4 was originally going to be a major departure from the first three books, introducing new main characters, moving it centuries into the future, etc.  Instead, this book was in the past with the same main characters but a radically different font.  4's main 'theme,' if any of these books has a theme, was backstories.  We told the backstories of as many people as we could.  We get Danté's mysterious past, which is still mysterious, Theódore's life before everlast, nothing about The Ptrocanfer, the early life of N.C. Radovan, who has become the main antagonist, and the backgrounds of two new characters: The Sneeeze and Senior Flour.  Theódore gets framed for everlast smuggling by N.C. Radovan, who has to create a whole city out of brainwashed people to get enough power to make that much everlast.  One of the most interesting parts of Twitch 4 comes at the very end: The N.C. Origins.  Coming from a particularly nasty pun (“Why is Vix afraid of Sven?  Because Sven Nate-Clyde”), Danté realized that Nate-Clyde has the same initials as N.C. Radovan, so another backstory was created.  Vix, who later becomes the famous thief <em>The Sneeeze</em>, is a car salesman, and Sven, who later drops the Sven and just becomes N.C. Radovan, is a young kid who later becomes a mafia boss.
