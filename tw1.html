                                    <ul>
                                        <li>‘I’ll give ya a free ipad if you can guess that which I’m doin’ here!’ the man exclaimed.  ‘Your robbing the bank,’ my uncle replied.  ‘WRONG!  IT’S ‘YOU’RE ROBBING THE BANK’!  YOU DIE’</li><hr>
                                        <li>The crisp sound, sounding like a gunshot in a bank robbery, sent a shiver down The Ptrocanfer’s back and then back up his front.</li><hr>
                                        <li><p>The grooves are like microscopic canyons; they have steep walls and have a river of liquid flowing through.  They are not at all unlike the Grand Canyon; being one of the most impressive canyons ever.  Majestic red walls line the outside of a rough rocky river.  Massive amounts of water flow through the river creating cascading rapids and rapid cascades.  The rugged terrain has abrupt, sharp spores of jagged rocks erupting from the canyon walls.  Violent turns in the river create a distinctive topography.  Unhealthy trees reach their bony hands out of the edge of the cliff desperately hoping to be rescued from the fearsomely tight grasp of the hard granite which holds them in place.  Green leaves and blossoms are scarce, and do not stand a chance against the terrifying red of the iron which contaminates the innocent soil in which the canyon was created. Wind shapes the rocks, trees, and bushes into thin pathetic spires with unnatural angles.</p> 
The process of creating a silicon chip is nothing like this.</li><hr>
                                        <li>The nervous system’s purpose simply is to be that which gives us the ability to allow us the ability which we must have in order to use that which is necessary in order to be used for the purpose of having the use of allowing living things to react to their surroundings.</li><hr>
                                        <li>The snow was as white as your knuckles in the middle of biology.</li><hr>
                                        <li>“I’m fine.  It’ll grow back before the next chapter.  Let’s get on with this, shall we?”</li><hr>
                                        <li>This computer would resemble real life in electrically shocking ways.</li><hr>
                                        <li>The torturer.  That was a sentence (well, technically not, but you know how it gets).</li><hr>
                                        <li>In fact, there is a whole line of Ptrocanfers, but that is another story for another time (I may tell you later (like in the third book (WOAH! I CAN SEE INTO THE FUTURE!)))</li><hr>
                                        <li>Even worse, the chair is positioned to the rear of a wooden table (Gasp!).</li><hr>
                                        <li>Let me clarify.  Her respect to respect was greater than her respect of showing respect and such her respect for respect in her mind, being the greater force of the two was the more pronounced, and more deserving of respecting the respect for respect, but in order to respect the respect of respect, the respect of showing respect is diminished because of the respect for respecting the showing of respect not being clarified, and hence not being as strong (for everyone knows that correlation means there must be a cause and effect relationship (that was sarcasm)) and hence since in the respect of  the respect of respecting respect, her respect was shown on one level, the respect of respecting having respected respecting showing her respect was not shown on the same level, it is difficult to tell in which manner her sincerity should be respected.  Clearer?</li><hr>
                                        <li>I also am aware that i randomly switched the narration of the story from being third person omniscient to first person.  i am also aware that ‘i’ should be capitalized.</li><hr>
                                        <li>Yes.  His last name is Midget [and his first name is The], so don’t get all sassy about being politically correct and calling him ‘The Short Person’</li><hr>
                                        <li>He was created by a rift in the evil powers of the universe (hi Bill (ok, that’s another story (for another time))).  He had been called The Midget for his whole life despite his being quite a large man.  He must have managed to survive, but become a much more mutilated, deformed, shorter man during the incident.  A terrifying encounter with a rare Polynesian six-foo-
To be continued!</li><hr>
                                        <li>In shock from having a student ask for more pain, the torturer collapsed to the floor and had a seizure.  He was fired later for not having controlled his emotions of great joy.</li><hr>
                                        <li>“I wouldn’t do that,” he cautioned. “The chicken you are eating now was my brother’s leg before he died of hyperchemipholia, which is a disease of being in chemistry class too long.”</li><hr>
                                        <li> Imagine the beautiful complexion of the Vasterbottenost which can be had for the low price of £9.00 and is described as being a pale yellow with a waxed rind, a crumbly, grainy, open texture and having a 31% fat content.  Being a hard artisan cheese, it can be spelled either Vasterbottenost or Västerbotten, and is from the Swedish region of Burträsk where it is made from the milk of cows.</li><hr>
                                        <li>I had a dream that night.  Not one of those dreams that you remember when you wake up.  No, it was a special dream.</li><hr>
                                        <li>“So, how can I tell if I am dreaming or not?” I asked him, but his response was terrifying.  He slowly looked around, put on one of those glasses that has a fake nose and mustache, and slowly walked up to me.  He quickly looked behind him and whispered in my ear: “I’ll never tell you that which you know.”  Then he vaporized.</li><hr>
                                        <li>You, being only a lowly reader, must now be confused as to who or whom (actually it’s just who [I LIED TO YOU!!!, it’s whom]) the Mystical Beast is.</li><hr>
                                        <li>Speaking of wilderness, have you ever wondered that which the difference is between grape jelly and WILD grape jelly?  Does this imply that normal grape jelly is made using tamed grapes?  If so, might I be so preposterous as to ask, “How does one tame a grape?”</li><hr>
                                        <li>A tumbleweed rolled in front of them disturbing the hypnotic waves in the sand.  A short gust of wind sprayed scalding sand into their faces and the tracks dissipated into the sand, but they rode on.  
</li><hr>
                                    </ul>
