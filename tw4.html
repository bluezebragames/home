										<h3>Good Excerpts</h3>
									</header>
                                    <ul><hr>
									<li>“Ok, Theodore, here’s the plan.  We’ve got to find a competent detective who knows the background.  Someone who uses his brains and his brawn, his toast and his marmalade, his bread and his pudding, his dog and his cat, his teeth and his nails, his nails and his hammer, his wheel and his chair, his roof and his ceiling, his rights and his wrongs, his wrongs and his lefts, his lefts and his writing utensils, his calculator and his graph paper, his piano and his organ, his organs and the ones donated to him by that guy in that car accident last tuesday, his dulcimer and his sitar, his elmer’s glue and his epoxy, possibly most importantly, his thrifty use of both compact discs and usb drives, his mother and his mother’s spouse, his sother and his sother’s mouse, the skin of his teeth and the teeth of his skin, his chai tea and his taichi, his apples and oranges, his citrus and artificial flavours, not to mention his cold hard ones and zeros…”</li><hr>
                                        <li>For a moment, his friends had a look of pure shock, as if the room had been filled with ionized particles.  After that embarrassing moment, confetti flew from the ceiling, and Theodore, Dante, and Senior Flour grabbed their respective instruments from a bag of those strange kazoo things with rolling paper that flies out when played.  The Ptrocanfer’s face became so red that the photo Dante took on his Sony DSLR camera became corrupted.  Señior Flour’s face was just as red, and between his exasperated gasps for air, he slapped his hand against the table in a feeble attempt to raise himself off of the floor, but alas, the effort was too great for him.  Every muscle in his body was preoccupied by the simple task of surviving under the strenuous conditions of his laughter.  Eventually he calmed down just enough that a fly could enter the opened window without worrying about being crushed against the wall by Señior Flour’s radiance. A few words escaped his enlarged lips as his face reduced from ‘traffic light red’ to ‘sunset on mars’.</li><hr>
                                        <li>“Shhhhhh!” the man replied as he reached towards his face, removed the glasses and peeled off a rubber mask.<br>
“Now I look completely different” he said as he reapplied the glasses.<br>
“No, you really don’t.  Isn't the point of a mask to conceal your actual appearance, and not look exactly the same?”
</li><hr>
                                        <li>“Firstly, Professor Yeast Powder, I would like to watch the rest of this.  Second, McDonald’s doesn’t deliver.  Third, McDonald’s doesn’t use helicopters as delivery trucks.  Fourth, the golden arches on the helicopter are more like deep orange.  Finally, Theodore knows exactly who we are because your men blatantly told him.”</li><hr>
                                        <li>Now was the moment. He had been losing sleep over it for the past few weeks. His breaths were short and sporadic, it was hard to breathe. It seemed so simple, inhale and exhale, he had done it all his life but now it seem an impossible task. As if someone had put a noose around his neck and tied the other end to to barbell then went about his way to throw the barbell out the window. Of course he didn't have much of a choice, inside that building across the street, in room 8053 was his only chance to clear his name. “Come on Theodore now's not the time to lose your grip,” he just had to keep saying it to himself.<br>
“Hey you alright there, bud?”<br>
Theódore jumped, nearly falling over from the weight of a metaphorical barbell.</li><hr>
                                        <li>Chris loved to cook.  He had dreams of showing up on the Food Network and winning every competition.  Never had he met a soul who could resist his barbequed chicken and baked beans.  If he had countertops like these, he wouldn’t need chopping boards anymore.  Cleaning up after marinating pork chops would be as easy as wiping a paper towel over the smooth surface.  He pulled out a pen and pretended it was a carrot, and then imagined he chopped it up with a business card.  He then threw the pen into a box of papers where it would boil for five minutes in a concoction of red wine and a dash of olive oil.  Before the cameras could return to him, he was gone.  Already at the paper shredder pulling out a batch of cookies that had been cooking at three hundred and fifty degrees.  In the blink of an eye he was at a filing cabinet using a spatula to place some juicy chicken onto a plate.</li><hr>
                                        <li>There was nothing Chris would rather do than become a professional chef.  He would be like a wrestler.  His real name would never be said, only the one he used in the court.  He would make a meal so good that all of his opponents would come to his restaurant during their off hours.  On yelp, his reviews would be six out of five stars.  Everywhere he went people would whisper things they heard about him.  They would look at him in awe and say that they wished they could be like the one and only Senor Flour.  Yeah, his name would be Senor Flour.  Nobody went out of their way to meet just another ‘Chris’, but Senor Flour would be a cook that everyone would enjoy.</li><hr>
